# Abnormal Event Detection in Multi-Camera Surveillance Systems

## Overview

This project implements a **real-time abnormal event detection system** using **YOLOv8** for object detection and **ResNet-50** for anomaly classification. It is designed for surveillance camera feeds and supports video files, webcam, and multi-camera extension.

Key features:

- Detects suspicious/abnormal events across 14 categories (e.g., Arson, Robbery, Shooting).
- Visualizes detections with green bounding boxes for normal events, red boxes for anomalies.
- Real-time inference using a hybrid YOLO + ResNet pipeline.
- Streamlit frontend for easy demo and testing.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Prepare dataset**

Download and place UCF Crime dataset images in `data/raw/<class_name>/`.

3. **Preprocess dataset**

Resize images to 224x224 for ResNet:

```bash
python -m src.preprocess
```

4. **Train ResNet classifier**

```bash
python -m src.train
```

5. **Evaluate trained model (optional)**

```bash
python -m src.evaluate
```

6. **Run YOLO-only detection (optional)**

```bash
python -m src.yolo_infer
```

7. **Run hybrid YOLO + ResNet inference**

```bash
python -m src.infer
```

8. **Run frontend**

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## Usage

- Upload video files or select "Use Webcam" in the frontend to start detection.
- View bounding boxes and anomaly classification live.
- Press `q` to quit any OpenCV window.

---

## Notes

- You can change hyperparameters and paths in `src/config.py`.
- For better accuracy, try larger YOLO models (yolov8s.pt) and train for more epochs.
- Multi-camera support can be added by extending the video capture in `src/infer.py` and frontend.
